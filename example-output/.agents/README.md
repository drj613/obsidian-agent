# .agents/ — LLM-Agnostic Agent Configuration

Generated by agents-bootstrap for the "example-output" vault.

## Directory Structure

```
.agents/
├── rules/        # Hard rules every agent must follow
├── commands/     # Reusable step-by-step workflows
├── personas/     # Agent personalities with specific expertise
├── context/      # Reference material and domain knowledge
├── hooks/        # Pre/post action checklists
└── state/        # Mutable state (optional, add later)
```

## How It Works

1. Root `AGENTS.md` is the entry point — lean, critical rules only.
2. Personas are activated by asking the agent to "act as the [persona]".
3. Commands are invoked by name.
4. Rules are always in effect.
5. Context files are loaded on demand.
6. Hooks are checklists that agents run through before/after actions.
