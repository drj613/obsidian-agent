# Vault Structure Rules

## Folders

| Folder | Purpose | Category |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `Work/` | [purpose] | [category value] |
| `School/` | [purpose] | [category value] |
| `Personal/` | [purpose] | [category value] |
| `Misc/` | [purpose] | [category value] |

## Index Convention

Every content section has a `00 - Index.md` hub linking to its contents.
When creating a note, always add it to its section's index.

## Cross-Referencing

- Every note should include a `**Related:**` section with links to connected notes
- Think in terms of the knowledge graph — what connects to what
