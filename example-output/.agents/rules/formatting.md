# Formatting Rules

## Links

- Either wiki links `[[Note]]` or markdown links `[text](path)` are acceptable
- Be consistent within a single note

## Note Naming

- Clean, descriptive titles
- No numbered prefixes
- No special characters that break links

## Markdown Conventions

- Use `#` headings in descending order
- Use `-` for unordered lists
- Use `- [ ]` for task items
- All content files are `.md`
